# CarbonStock
## - This project used linear regression and the scikit learn framework to analyze S&P 500 Stocks.
## - The model predicts whether the market cap of specific companies will increase in the coming quarter based on 4 features: Free Cash Flow Firm Q/Q Growth, EBIT Q/Q Growth, Profit Margin, and Net Profit. We extracted this data from a stock record API.
## The second half of this project involves using AWS Lambda to trigger this model and provide the User Interface as an Amazon Alexa Skill.
## For example you can ask, "Alexa, ask Carbon Stock if Yahoo!'s stock price will increase this quarter?" Alexa will trigger the model and respond with the predicition.
